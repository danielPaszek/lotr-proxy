This is a project for "Advanced internet application" on my CS studies. <br>
It is a fully working, dockerized web application with additional REST API endpoints to connect by mobile app (in progress). <br>
You can say it is a proxy for https://the-one-api.dev/ <br>
It receives a request, checks if it has data matching this request, if not then it makes a request to "the one api", and sends data back to user.
